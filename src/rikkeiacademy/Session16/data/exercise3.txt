Character streams in Java are designed to handle 16-bit Unicode input and output.
Among the classes associated with character streams, FileReader and FileWriter are frequently employed.
Internally, FileReader relies on FileInputStream, while FileWriter relies on FileOutputStream.
The key distinction is that FileReader reads two bytes, and FileWriter writes two bytes, respectively.
